# What is this project?
This project will attempt to provide a set of actions for a patient suffering from nCov-19. The present outlook suggests that health care systems will rapidly become overwhelmed by patients in need of primary care, thus requiring a care $

By defining an administrable care plan, this project will attempt to provide people with information that may reduce their need to obtain primary care, or define support where primary care is overloaded.

## Curators
This project is currently in genesis. We need professionals and curators that can assist with the management and definition of the strategy we suggest. If you can assist, please apply to the project via a merge request or DM with your re$

## Definition of treatment
For the end user the most easily comprehensible instructions is a flow diagram. We should realise that said strategy will be in constant revision, and must define a manner of peer review and effective adaptation.

Any flow should initially attempt to determine progression of the disease, and the define a care plan for said phase.


## Equipment limitations

We must assume a limitation of medical supply during treatment. Where possible any plan should include instruction for assembly of necessary tooling and consider the most commonly available prerequisites first.

# How can I help (software)

## Responsive UX for basic workflow (suggest React or Angular)
Implement cross platform/browser flow to interpret status and define treatment plan

## Adaptable model for peer-review and workflow (suggest Python/Django + DRF)

Models that assist with definition, review, revision and provision of instruction via restful API.
